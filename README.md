# Loop Optimization Demo

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Loop Optimization Demo** is a C-based application designed to demonstrate the fundamental differences and similarities between `for` and `while` loops. The program takes a user-defined number of seconds and converts them into a standard **Hours:Minutes:Seconds** format, tracking the execution flow and iteration count for both loop types.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
* **Loop Comparison:** To visualize the syntax and structural differences between `for` and `while` loops.
* **Control Flow Analysis:** To monitor the `iteration_count` variable to see how many times the CPU enters a loop block.
* **Logic Verification:** To ensure that different programming structures yield the same mathematical output.

## 🛠 Utility
This tool is useful for:
* **Beginners in C:** Understanding how to use the modulo operator `%` and integer division `/`.
* **Logic Testing:** Demonstrating that "optimization" can involve choosing the right loop structure for readability and performance.
* **Time Calculation:** A simple utility to convert large integers into human-readable time.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Language:** C
* **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* **Compiler:** GCC
* **Version Control:** GitHub

## 🚀 Future Scope
1.  **Efficiency Benchmarking:** Integrating `<time.h>` to measure execution speed in nanoseconds.
2.  **Scalability:** Expanding the logic to include days, months, and leap year calculations.
3.  **Data Logging:** Exporting iteration results to a `.csv` or `.txt` file for further data analysis.
